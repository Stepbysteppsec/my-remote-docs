### When Can You NOT Reduce a Relative Clause?

1. When the relative clause has a **modal verb** (like _can_, _must_, _will_, etc.):
    
    - **Example**: _"The book that you must read is on the table."_
        - You **cannot** reduce this because _"must"_ is a modal verb and cannot be dropped.
2. When the relative clause involves **two subjects** (you can't simply turn them into a participle):
    
    - **Example**: _"The man who is my neighbor and who works with me is very friendly."_
        - You **cannot** reduce this easily into a single participle.
